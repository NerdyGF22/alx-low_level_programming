# SEARCH ALGORITHM
Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values

# What is a linear search
- a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list
- sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched

# Binary search
-  binary search, also known as half-interval search,[1] logarithmic search,[2] or binary chop,
- is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array
- Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the arra

#  Jump search algorithm
a jump search or block search refers to a search algorithm for ordered lists. It works by first checking all items Lkm, where k âˆˆ N {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {N} } k\in \mathbb {N} and m is the block size, until an item is found that is larger than the search key.
